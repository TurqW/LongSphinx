* `!pick thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4`: Randomly picks one of the things.
* `!pick 2 good, fast, cheap`: Randomly picks two of the things. No repetition, order is random.
* `!pick @role`: Randomly picks a member with that role. Numbers can be used here too.
Commas between options are required if you have multi-word options, optional otherwise. If you use any commas, you must have commas between every option.
